# CVA Calculation

CVA is the expected loss due to counterparty default (i.e. risk of counterparty failing to fulfil its side of the derivative contract)

    In simple terms, CVA = Expected Exposure (EE) x Probability of Default (PD) x Loss Given Default (LGD)

This project aims to demonstrate how CVA is calculated, and how it can be used for risk management strategies & P&L explanation
